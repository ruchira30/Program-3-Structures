# Structures
### This program defines a structure `student_details` that contains information about a student, including their name, roll number, and GPA. The program prompts the user to enter information for five students, and then displays the information entered.The program uses a loop to store information for each of the five students. The `roll` field of the `student_details` structure is set to the current index of the loop variable, and the user is prompted to enter the student's name and GPA. The `scanf()` function is used to read input from the user.After all of the student information has been entered, the program uses another loop to display the information entered for each student. The `puts()` function is used to output the student's name because it is a string.Overall, this program demonstrates how structures can be used to store related data and how loops can be used to perform repetitive tasks.
